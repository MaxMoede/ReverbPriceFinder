#Reverb Price Finder! v 1.0

This is a simple chrome extension that allows a user to find the average sale price of an item on reverb.

HOW TO USE:
```
You must generate your own reverb api key (https://www.reverb-api.com/docs/getting-started)
Create a config.js file, and declare a var MY_KEY equal to your api key (in string format.)
Save the config.js file in the main directory
Load unpacked chrome extension
Once the extension is running, right click on selected text, and click 'Lookup 'selection' on reverb'
An alert should pop up on the screen showing the average price of the product.
```
